# Picture matcher (Scanner Phase 1 prototype)

Status: **prototype, not used by scanning yet.** Today's scan path (Ollama / Gemini through `scan_queue.py`, `scan_providers.py` and `api/recognize.py`) is unchanged. This is Phase 1 of `docs/SCAN_RESEARCH.md` §3.8: build the matcher, measure it on the T340, and read the numbers in **Settings → Data & sync → Scanner lab** (admins only).

## How it works

```
photo
  ├─ detect.py    find the card (OpenCV contours, largest convex quad near 63:88 inside the guide area),
  │               flatten it to 630×880; no credible quad → plain guide crop (low confidence)
  ├─ embed.py     DINOv2 ViT-S/14 (ONNX Runtime, CPU, 3 threads), 224×224 → 384 numbers, L2-normalised;
  │               the card at 0° and at 180°
  ├─ index.py     numpy cosine search in an in-memory matrix of every English card picture → top 20
  ├─ ocr.py       RapidOCR on the bottom strips (number/total, set code), optionally the HP strip
  └─ pipeline.py  decide with the existing rules in `api/recognize.py` + picture similarity and lead
                  → "decided" (with the mechanism) or "unsure" (with the reason and the top matches)
```

The decision (`pipeline.decide`) reuses `_candidate_rank_key` and `_metadata_decision` from `api/recognize.py` (number, printed total, set code, regulation mark, artist, HP), so the matcher and today's scanner agree on what counts as evidence. On top of that:

- a rules decision is accepted only if the chosen printing is also among the 10 closest pictures and its similarity is at least `CARD_MATCH_SIM_MIN_WITH_RULES` (0.55);
- if the number matches several printings, the picture breaks the tie only with a clear gap (`CARD_MATCH_LEAD_MIN_PICTURE_ONLY`, 0.06);
- with no usable number, the picture alone decides only at similarity ≥ `CARD_MATCH_SIM_MIN_PICTURE_ONLY` (0.80) **and** lead ≥ 0.06;
- the index is English only and the language is not used as evidence.

The thresholds are **provisional**; the benchmark records every photo's features so they can be tuned once the labelled set exists.

The pipeline is pure: it reads the index and, through a `candidate_loader`, the catalogue; it writes nothing.

On disk (`CARD_MATCH_DIR`, default `/app/data/card-match`; mounted in `docker-compose.nonprod.yml`):

- `index/<model>/vectors.npy` + `entries.json` (card id and picture key per row, build time, count);
- `reports/benchmark-<kind>-<timestamp>.json`;
- `hires/` (cached high-resolution TCGdex pictures for the synthetic photos);
- `autorun.json` (marker so the nonprod autorun happens once per matcher version).

## The index

- Source: the server's cached small pictures (`image_cache`, filled by `CardPictureWarmer`); English, physical cards only (digital-only TCG Pocket printings are left out, as the scanner does).
- A row is `(card id, picture key)`. The key comes from `card_picture_packs.card_image_key`, which carries a hash of the picture URL, so a changed picture is re-embedded and an unchanged one is reused. Changing the model builds a new index next to the old one.
- Builds checkpoint every 1,000 vectors, so a restart continues.
- 20,000 cards × 384 × 4 bytes ≈ 31 MB in RAM.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CARD_MATCH_DIR` | `/app/data/card-match` | index, reports, cached pictures |
| `CARD_MATCH_MODEL_DIR` | `/app/card-match-models` | where the image has the model file |
| `CARD_MATCH_THREADS` | `3` (1–8) | ONNX Runtime and OpenCV thread cap |
| `SCAN_MATCHER_AUTORUN` | off | **nonprod only**: once per matcher version, after startup, fill the picture cache if needed, build the index, run the synthetic benchmark |
| `SCAN_MATCHER_INDEX_AFTER_SYNC` | off | after `schedule_after_sync` (card sync → picture warm-up), add the new pictures to the index; nonprod sets it |
| `CARD_MATCH_SIM_MIN_WITH_RULES`, `CARD_MATCH_SIM_MIN_PICTURE_ONLY`, `CARD_MATCH_LEAD_MIN_PICTURE_ONLY` | 0.55 / 0.80 / 0.06 | decision thresholds |

Prod sets none of the automatic flags. An admin can still press the buttons on prod, but prod has no `card-match` volume, so results would not survive a container re-create.

Limits: one index build or benchmark at a time (a second request gets `started: false`); jobs run in a thread at `nice 10` where the OS allows it; ONNX Runtime gets 3 intra-op threads and OpenCV 3.

## Reading the Scanner lab

- **English cards indexed — N of M**: pictures in the index vs. English physical cards with a catalogue picture. A gap means pictures are not cached yet (run "Prepare card pictures" first) or the build is not finished.
- **Build index / Update index**: embeds the pictures that have no vector yet. **Run benchmark (synthetic)**: about 400 English cards, a phone-like photo of each (background, tilt, perspective, colour cast, glare, blur, noise, JPEG, card at 55–65% of the frame, 10% upside down), including 50 reprint traps (a name with at least four printings) and 80 holo / full-art rarities. **Run on diagnostics**: the traces under `SCAN_TRACE_DIR` with a confirmed answer, shown next to what today's Ollama path got on the same photos.
- The report shows the §3.8 pass bar, each row marked ✓ (passes), ✗ (fails) or · (not measured):
  1. right printing in the top 20 ≥ 97%;
  2. decided without a model ≥ 70%, of which right ≥ 98%;
  3. matcher vs. today's Ollama path (read from the labelled report's Ollama block; judged by a person for now);
  4. 95th percentile per photo ≤ 1.5 s and extra memory ≤ 1.5 GB.
- **Synthetic numbers are an upper bound**: the photos are made from the same artwork the index holds. The labelled run is the honest one.
- Memory is read from `/proc` (Linux only), so it is "not measured" on a Windows or macOS host. "Extra" is the peak of the whole backend process minus its size when the job started.

## OCR choice

RapidOCR (PP-OCRv4 detection and recognition models, ONNX Runtime) installs cleanly into the slim image when installed with `--no-deps` (its wheel otherwise drags in the full `opencv-python`, which needs system GL libraries and clashes with `opencv-python-headless`). The models ship inside the wheel (about 16 MB), so nothing downloads at runtime. Tesseract would have needed an apt package and a separate binary; it stays the fallback idea if RapidOCR proves too slow on the T340. A tight bottom strip is read first; the wider strip only if no number came out. HP is read only when `CardMatcher(read_hp=True)`; it is off by default because the strip is the slowest to read and HP is weak evidence.

## Models in the image

`backend/Dockerfile` runs `fetch_card_match_models.py` after installing the requirements: it downloads the pinned URL, checks the sha256 and puts the file in `/app/card-match-models`. This layer is cached until `model_specs.py` changes. At runtime `OnnxEmbedder` checks the sha256 again before loading. To add a second model (MobileCLIP, SigLIP) for comparison, add an entry to `MODEL_SPECS`; the index is stored per model name. The phone can later load the same `.onnx` file with `onnxruntime-web`, and the `.npy`/ids format is plain.

## Next steps

1. **Read the T340 numbers** (this PR) and tune the thresholds; fix the stage the report names if the pass bar fails.
2. **Labelled benchmark** once trainers have scanned 300–400 cards with diagnostics on: press "Run on diagnostics".
3. **Shadow mode** on nonprod: a server setting runs the matcher beside Ollama, records agreement in the traces, changes nothing the trainers see.
4. **Primary mode** with the Ollama fallback only when the gaming PC answers a quick check, and "straight to the inbox" (with the picture top matches) when the scanner is unreachable, as the owner chose.
5. **Phone version** reusing the same model file and index format.
